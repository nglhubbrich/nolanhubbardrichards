          "Hey, YouTubers!! It's time for me to throw my hat in the ring. Problem is: I've never done any of this stuff
          before! I'm planning on going from faker to maker, and this YouTube channel is going to chronicle every step
          of the journey. All the way from most-likely making super crap-tastic replicas to hopefully getting to some
          Adam Savage style one day builds. So, come on in to Golden Moose Laboratory and enjoy the ride!!"

        <p>
          The project was fairly simple, this YouTube creator was looking for Logo for his upcoming channel. Something
          catchy but simple enough that it would translate easily from the YouTube bubble-style avatar to website
          branding or even hats and t-shirts if the channel were to blow up. Looking for a funky twist on the classic
          circle-and-banner logo with a slim colour pallette. So, I loaded up Gravit Designer and went to town.

          The words 'bright' and 'funky' were used a lot when in the discussions, so I summoned my inner '90's punk
          rocker; threw on some Blink-182 and grabbed some colours; switching them around a couple times to give some
          variety will make them pop no matter where he uses them. I'm hoping this channel takes off cause I think
          these would make some pretty sick hats.
