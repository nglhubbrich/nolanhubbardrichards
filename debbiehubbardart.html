        <h3 class="project-title">Project Details</h3>
        <p>
          My Mom, Debbie, has been painting and drawing and just generally crafty for as long as I've been around, and
          I'm sure longer. I have always encouraged her to show off her creations, and when I wanted to get my digital
          feet wet with web development, I thought of no better project than to build her a webpage to do just that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting from scratch learning about different web frameworks and then seeing it all come together was
          awesome. Definitely a challenge, but incredibly fun at the same time. I got to play around with some very
          cool effects, such as a Light and Dark mode that gets triggered by the time of day (your eyes can thank me
          later) and an animated menu page. Definitely can't wait to do more!
