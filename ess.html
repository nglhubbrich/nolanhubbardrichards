          As soon as I found out about Sarcan School and the Dashboard feature, the ol' gears up top started spinning.
          I thought (and still think) that it was the coolest thing ever. This is my jam!! I immediately needed it for
          myself. And while I am not a School, nor do I have the intention of converting into one, I decided to set my
          sights on making one for myself.

          At first, it was just a personal pet project. Just something I could load onto my phone or my computer and
          use for myself. But as I went about researching what I would need to do and how to do it, the pet project was
          turning into a full-fledged application, so I just went with it.

          I was mainly focused on just tracking how many of each container type I was bringing in (aluminum is my
          favourite and the most energy efficient material type, I was looking to increase aluminum while decreasing
          the rest). But that quickly morphed in to what are the effects of recycling said containers? And in that same
          vein, more and more features would pop into the noggin', and I would set out to try and include them.

          The Energy Savings calculation came from the EPA website and a tool they use called 'iwarm'. Essentially, it
          takes the energy equivalent of the difference between making raw materials vs using new ones. It is very in
          depth and I encourage you to check it out.

          Once I added in the User Account ability, of course competition and comparison just felt right. What else
          sparks progress more than someone else being more progressier than you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Still deep in development, I am hoping to get a testable version out later this year. Stay Tuned!!
