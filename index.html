    <p>
      Hey! It's a pleasure to make your virtual acquaintance! Allow me to
      introduce myself: My name is (in case you didn't catch my super
      subtle header) Nolan Hubbard-Richards. I work for Sarcan Recycling as an
      assistant supervisor at the Regina Vic East Depot, and have for the past
      ten years. With my deep passion for the environment, it has been a match
      made in heaven. Sarcan and I go together like Habanero peppers and
      strawberry jam (seriously. try it.)<span id="dots">...</span></p></span><span id="more">
      <p>On the personal side, I live in Regina, Saskatchewan with my wife
        where I spend my spare time walking our 5 dogs (yes, you read that
        right: FIVE dogs. But 3 of them are chihuahuas, so they only count as
        1) or 'arting' around. I play guitar, paint and draw, make model props from
        my favourite movies, coding and programming, or building projects with
        arduinos and raspberry pi. I think the term thrown around these days
        would be 'maker'. I like to make the things that I see in my
        imagination real. Be it a picture that I want to look at, a song I
        want to hear, or a homemade gadget to automate my home. If I create it
        in my mind, I want to create it in my hands. You can usually find me
        hunkered over my desk, working out the plans for my next project.</p>
      <p>
        I like to consider myself a lifelong learner, as well. I love learning
        new things or diving into an area of study that I haven't tried
        before. Often, if in the process of creating the master plans for my
        next project I find that I am not sure how to do something, I will try
        as best I can to learn everything I can about that something.</p>
      <p>But, that's enough of me gassing on about myself. Have a look around and I hope you like what you see!</p>

        Everyone is on their phones these days, and they have come to expect their lifestyles to be reflected in these
        devices and the apps on them. Inspired by Sarcan School, 'ESS: Earth Saver Stats' is an app that attempts to
        reflect the lifestyles of the more 'Earth Friendly' among us.
