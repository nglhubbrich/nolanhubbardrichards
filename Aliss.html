        <h3 class="project-title">The Details</h3>
        <p>
          First, a little back story. The Connexus Business Incubator teamed
          up with Hack Regina and InnovationSask to bring the first annual 24
          hour Start-Up Competition. The idea is that whole bunch of up and
          coming programmers and designers get together to pitch their ideas
          for a start-up company. You get 60 seconds (yes, only sixty
          seconds!) to wow everyone with your pitch. Afterwards, the rag-tag
          group of innovators vote on which ideas are strong enough to move
          on. If your pitch moves on, you get to recruit team members and once
          your team is formed, you have 24 hours to plan, design and build a
          minimum viable product that, if you make it far enough, you get to
          pitch to actual real-world investors (think Dragons Den style).
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought this would be the perfect platform to share an idea that
          would eventually morph into 'Aliss'. In short, I wanted to harness
          the power of machine learning to receive, analyze and translate
          real-time brain activity into a signal that a computer program can
          understand and use. Whether it is used to control a character in a
          Virtual Reality video game, or a way for someone afflicted by a
          debilitating neurological disorder to communicate and connect with
          their outside world in a way that they no longer can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out, others liked it as much as I did and it was picked up to
          move on.
        </p>
        <h3 class="project-title">My Roles</h3>
        <h4>Recruitment</h4>
        <p>
          The first task I had was to recruit my team. I needed some skilled
          coders willing to take on such an ambitious goal and some creative
          minds for beautification. After some impromptu 'interviews', I was
          able to select 4 very skilled people: 3 programmers with backgrounds
          in data analysis and machine learning(ML), and a designer with a
          business background that would work great for the market research that
          we would need.
        </p>

        <h4>Sharpening our Vision</h4>
        <p>
          With time being a limited resource, we needed to quickly hash out
          what our final product was going to be. What was attainable within
          the time-frame while still achieving our lofty goals. Based on team
          member strengths, we decided on the technologies we would use, and
          created 3 base goals (a robust ML backend, an easy to use Interface,
          and a target market) to meet that we would blend together to make
          our final product.
        </p>

        <h4>Delegating Assignments</h4>
        <p>
          With our goals set out, it was time for the grind. I Matched up team
          members to appropriate tasks, once again, based on what I viewed
          their areas of expertise to be. I assigned 2 of our programmers with
          researching and developing the backend, while another programmer and
          I would get to work on the product branding and design of the
          frontend. I had our business designer start market research to find
          out what was out there in the industry and where we would fit in.
          Game on.
        </p>

        <h4>Design and Branding</h4>
        <p>
          I am a big fan of science fiction movies (and you can't deny that
          this project smells a little science fiction-y!). I also love giving
          nods to some of those movies in my projects. Aliss pays homage to
          one of my favourite movie franchises and characters: Project Alice
          from Resident Evil. I did some wordsmithing to make it work as Aliss
          stands for 'Advanced Learning Integration Software Solutions'. Once
          the name was in place, the logo and main branding just popped out
          and all that was left was choosing an attractive colour pallette and
          working it in all throughout the user interface.
        </p>

        <h4>Constant Re-evaluation</h4>
        <p>
          Steadily checking in on the other team members to gauge our progress
          so far, and where we were headed. Being able to identify problem
          areas and pivot ideas, reassigning goals on the fly, turned out to
          be a crucial cornerstone to our success.
        </p>

        <h4>Presentation</h4>
        <p>
          We had made it through to the final 5 start-ups, which meant that we
          would need to present a Minimum Viable Product to the judges. In 3
          minutes. Better than 60 seconds, but come on! We were able to pack
          in as much information into a fairly flashy presentation. However, it wasn't enough for us to bring home the
          prize, but I could not be happier with how far we had made it, and the progress that we achieved in such a
          short time.
